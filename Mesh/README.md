# Mesh - The Coordination Layer for GeoSpatial Data

<img width="2920" height="1548" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/397486b0-2fa0-4e24-83b1-4fdca3e0a1cb" />

## Inspiration

3D model processing has always been a bottleneck in geospatial workflows. Traditional pipelines require complex software stacks, manual component extraction, and hours of processing time. Engineers, educators, and researchers spend countless hours breaking down 3D models, identifying components, and creating educational visualizations — all through tedious, error-prone manual processes.

We asked ourselves: What if you could process 3D meshes as easily as you process images?

What if, instead of spending hours in Blender or CAD software manually extracting components, you could upload a GLB file and have AI automatically identify, annotate, and explain every part? What if you could control 3D visualizations with physical hardware, making complex models as intuitive to explore as picking up a physical object?

That's when Mesh was born.

## What it does

Mesh is an AI-powered 3D model processing platform that automates mesh component extraction, identification, and educational visualization — without complex pipelines.

### Core Features

#### 1. AI-Powered Component Identification

**Gemini Pro Integration**: Real-time 3D mesh component identification via OpenRouter API. When users trigger AI identification, Gemini analyzes highlighted mesh components from screenshots, providing structured JSON responses with part names, descriptions, categories, and confidence scores. It also generates annotated images with wireframe overlays and labels for educational visualization.

**GPT-4 Mesh Explanation**: Processes identified mesh components to generate detailed educational explanations of individual object meshes. After component identification, GPT-4 analyzes mesh geometry, position, and context to provide comprehensive descriptions, functional explanations, and educational content about each component's role and characteristics.

**Automated Component Extraction**: Gemini Pro analyzes 3D model structures and intelligently identifies individual components within complex meshes. The model processes geometric data and contextual information to segment models into distinct parts — like identifying a helmet, chest plate, and gauntlets in a character model — without manual labeling.

#### 2. Dual Processing Pipeline

**SAM3D META Model**: Custom-built 3D segmentation model powered by Meta's SAM (Segment Anything Model) architecture, fine-tuned for geospatial mesh processing. It performs automated component extraction and mesh segmentation directly from 3D models, providing superior accuracy especially on larger meshes (>100 mesh objects).

**Sketchfab Import Pipeline**: Imports pre-processed 3D models from Sketchfab's platform, leveraging their optimized meshes and metadata for faster rendering times. This solution offers faster processing with pre-optimized assets, especially for smaller to medium-sized models.

**Performance Metrics**:

#### 3. Interactive 3D Visualization

**Real-time Mesh Viewer**: Built with Three.js and React Three Fiber, featuring:

- Holo and solid view modes
- Component isolation and highlighting
- Exploded view with adjustable distance
- Mesh splitting and component extraction
- Bloom post-processing effects
- Smooth camera controls with OrbitControls

**Interactive Component Selection**: Click or hover over any mesh component to see detailed information, trigger AI identification, or isolate specific parts for closer examination.

#### 4. Arduino M5StickCPlus2 Motion Control

**Camera Stick**: Real-time 3D mesh rotation control using the M5StickCPlus2's IMU sensors. The device streams quaternion orientation data via BLE at 500Hz, enabling smooth camera rotation in the 3D viewer. Button A toggles streaming, Button B triggers mesh splitting.

**Object Stick**: Button-based controller for 3D model interactions. Sends special quaternion patterns via BLE to trigger specific actions:

- Button A: Triggers AI identification (q = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0})
- Button B: Cycles through zoom levels (2x zoom in, 2x zoom out)

**Technical Specifications**:

- Streaming Rate: 500Hz BLE quaternion updates
- Gyro Calibration: 250 samples (1s bias estimation)
- Latency: <2ms end-to-end response
- Madgwick Filter: Fuses gyro (rad/s) + accel (g) for orientation
- Relative Quaternion: q_rel = qCurr × conj(qRef) for re-centering

#### 5. File Management & Export

**Upload Support**: Upload your own GLB files created on any CAD software to break down and learn about its components in real time. Our intelligent mesh analysis automatically identifies individual parts, materials, and structural elements.

**Export Capabilities**: Export individual components or complete assemblies with precise measurements and material properties. Compatible with major CAD platforms including SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Fusion 360, and Blender.

**Supported Formats**: GLB (with more formats coming soon!)

**Max File Size**: 100MB

#### 6. Sketchfab Integration

**Model Search**: Search Sketchfab's extensive library of downloadable 3D models directly from the interface. Intelligent scoring algorithm prioritizes exact matches, then partial matches, then tag-based results.

**Automatic Import**: Selected models are automatically downloaded and processed, with optimized mesh extraction and component identification.

**Filtering**: Automatically filters for downloadable models with reasonable polygon counts (100-100k faces) to ensure smooth processing.
